# how dockerfile and images are related?
    When you run docker build -t <image_name>, Docker looks for a file named Dockerfile in the current directory (unless specified otherwise).
    
    Relationship:
        Dockerfile → used to build → Docker Image → can be run as → Docker Container


# What is context do in skaffold?
    ANS=> In your skaffold.yaml file, the context field under build.artifacts refers to the build context for Docker.
          The build context is the directory that Docker will use as the reference point when building the container image.
